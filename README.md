## Sine Curve Fitting Neural Network
This repository contains implementations of a Neural Network for fitting a sine curve using various approaches. The models are developed using both raw NumPy and popular deep learning libraries like Keras.

## Approaches Implemented
# Numpy-Based Neural Network

A basic neural network implemented from scratch using NumPy. Two cases are covered: one where one input corresponds to one output and another with multiple inputs and one output.
Numpy-Based Neural Network with Activation Functions

A more sophisticated neural network implemented from scratch using NumPy. It includes activation functions such as ReLU and Sigmoid to capture non-linearities.
Keras Neural Network

Utilizing the Keras library to implement a neural network for sine curve fitting. This approach showcases the simplicity and efficiency of deep learning libraries.
Results
The results include visualizations of predicted values against target values, performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) scores.

## Libraries Used
NumPy: For mathematical operations and neural network implementation.
Keras: For high-level neural network building and training.

## Notes
The NumPy-based implementations serve as educational resources for understanding the fundamentals of neural networks.
The Keras implementation demonstrates a more concise and library-dependent approach.
Feel free to explore and experiment with the code. If you encounter any issues or have improvement suggestions, please open an issue.

Happy coding and sine curve fitting!
